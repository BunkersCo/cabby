This guide provides installation instructions for Cabby.


Build and install Cabby
=======================

You can automatically install the latest Cabby release from the `Python
Package Index <http://pypi.python.org/>`_ (PyPI) using ``pip``::

   (envname) $ pip install cabby

(In case you're feeling old-fashioned:: downloading a source tarball, unpacking
it and installing it manually with ``python setup.py install`` should also
work.)


Versioning
==========

Releases of Cabby are given major.minor.revision version numbers, where major and minor correspond to the roadmap Intelworks has. The revision` number is used to indicate a fixpack.
